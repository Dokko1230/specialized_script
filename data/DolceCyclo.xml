<description>Going long doesn’t have to leave you a dollar short. The Dolce is a bike that will help you achieve your fitness and distance goals, all while respecting your budget and needs. With its comfortable and fatigue-busting ride quality, courtesy of the FACT carbon fork with Zertz and Women's Endurance Geometry, the Dolce is the perfect bike for social rides or weekly workouts, and is a great addition to your fitness arsenal.</description></family_experience>
<headline>RIDE WITH CONFIDENCE</headline>

<features><feature1>WOMEN'S A1 FRAME</feature1>
<what1>WHAT: Lightweight alloy frames with oversized downtubes, shaped seatstays, and Women’s Endurance Geometry. Plus, Zertz dampers on Comp, Elite, and Sport models.</what1>
<why1>WHY: Provides predictable handling and contributes to a comfortable ride.</why1>
<how1>HOW: The larger downtube increases torsional stiffness, while the S-shaped seatstays with Zertz increase compliance and vibration absorption for an efficient, yet comfortable ride. To achieve endurance geometry, we optimise the tubesets and frame layout for a more comfortable position.</how1>
<feature2>ZERTZ INSERTS</feature2>
<what2>WHAT: Zertz viscoelastic dampers inserted into the carbon fork on all models and Zertz in the seatstays on Comp, Elite, and Sport models.</what2>
<why2>WHY: Absorbs road vibration to minimise fatigue and create a more comfortable ride.</why2>
<how2>HOW: Vibrations travel from the road through the wheels and up through the frame and fork. Putting dampers at the mid-section of each fork leg and seatstay helps dissolve vibrations before they reach the rider’s hands and body.</how2>
<feature3>WOMEN'S COMPONENTS</feature3>
<what3>WHAT: Women’s Body Geometry Riva saddle and Comp handlebar with 75mm reach and 123mm drop.</what3>
<why3>WHY: The saddle design relieves soft tissue pressure, while the shallower bend in the handlebar allows a closer reach to the brake levers for added comfort and confidence in the drops.</why3>
<how3>HOW: We spec each bike individually based on frame size and geometry. Through pressure mapping tests with Dr. Roger Minkow, we optimise the foam densities and cutouts in our saddles to relieve soft tissue discomfort.</how3></features>
