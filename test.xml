<features><feature1>LIGHT AND RESPONSIVE FRAME</feature1>
<what1>WHAT: Double-butted A1 Premium Aluminium and E5 Premium Aluminium frames.</what1>
<why1>WHY: Light weight frame offers unsurpassed quality and features our proven geometry for precise handling.</why1>
<how1>HOW: Through methodical tube shaping and enhanced weld techniques, our engineers manipulate every aspect of the frame for experience-specific performance.</how1>
<feature2>AXIS WHEELSET AND ESPOIR TYRES</feature2>
<what2>WHAT: High-performance AXIS wheelset and Espoir tyres.</what2>
<why2>WHY: For durable performance, plus reliable and confident handling with low rolling resistance.</why2>
<how2>HOW: Specialized Espoir 25c tyres deliver increased comfort and efficiency when cornering, and feature BlackBelt protection for fewer flats. Strong, efficient and highly engineered AXIS wheelset provides a stable, confident ride.</how2>
<feature3>SMARTWELD TECHNOLOGY</feature3>
<what3>WHAT: Smartweld technology.</what3>
<why3>WHY: For a light, stiff and most compliant ride.</why3>
<how3>HOW: A breakthrough in the weld location allows for a more durable, stiffer headtube junction which means more material in low stress areas can be removed. Size-specific tubes allow engineers to tune the ride for ultimate compliance.</how3>
<feature4>BODY GEOMETRY TOUCHPOINTS</feature4>
<what4>WHAT: Specialized Riva saddle and short-reach bars.</what4>
<why4>WHY: To relieve common rider pressure/pain points while riding.</why4>
<how4>HOW: The Specialized ergonomically designed, Riva Body Geometry saddle is lab tested to ensure blood flow to sensitive arteries, which alleviates rider discomfort. Short-reach drop bars improve a rider’s position to create a more comfortable, confident position for long rides.</how4></features>
